education:
    - degree: MSc of informatics
      university: University of Applied Sciences, Leiden
      time: 2012 - 2017
      details: |
        This study taught me the basics of how to write software. 
        It all starts with creating a website and some simple java. After 
        the first year I specialisted myself in interaction-technology and 
        learned how to design, create and test web and native apps. I did a 
        minor sensor-technology to broaden my knowledge and I enjoyed it a 
        lot! I made an IoT device to track different variables for valuable 
        packages. For my final exam I created a data visualisation system 
        for a industrial steam expander that was made with react/firebase/python.
